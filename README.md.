# PublicSDK
Public Android, iOS and Python SDK's for the goTenna

First read [goTennaSDKIntro.pdf](goTennaSDKIntro.pdf)

NOTE: We have removed the documentation & applications for upgrading your Mesh units to firmware v1.1.12 - This process relied on an architecture that we are no longer going to support. We will be deploying an updated version of the Mesh app to iOS and Android app stores, which will contain firmware v1.1.12 - In the meantime, if you need to upgrade your Mesh, please contact support@gotenna.com, we apologize for the inconvience.

### Contents
- [android-public-sdk](android-public-sdk) - SDK for Android
- [iOS-Public-SDK](ios-public-sdk) - SDK for iOS
- [python-public-sdk](python-public-sdk) - SDK for Python
- [goTenna Android SDK JavaDocs](https://gotenna.github.io/PublicSDK/android-public-sdk/javadocs/)
- [goTenna iOS SDK Docs](https://github.com/gotenna/PublicSDK/tree/master/ios-public-sdk/GoTennaSDKDocs/docs)

Each subdirectory has a readme.txt file that explains how to install and use the SDK.

#### App Token
goTenna uses an App Token to differentiate between different apps on the network. Apps can only communicate with other apps that use the same App Token. This allows an app to coexist with the goTenna app, but not intermix the messages being received.

Before you can use the sdk, you must setup your application token. This must be done before you use any methods from the SDK. You must set your application token before attempting to pair with a goTenna. See specific platform documentation and the sample apps for details on how to pair.

All developers are required to request a unique App Token from [http://www.gotenna.com/pages/sdk](http://www.gotenna.com/pages/sdk)
